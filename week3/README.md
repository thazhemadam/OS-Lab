# Week 3

1.  **fork_fibonacci.c**<br>
        Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates the Fibonacci sequence in
        the child process. The number of the sequence should be provided as a command line argument.
<br><br>
2.  **partial_sum_and_product.c**<br>
        Write a C program that uses the child to compute partial sums and parent to compute the 
        partial products of an array of integers. Both child and parent should print the respective
        total sum and product values.
<br><br>
3.  **fork_exec_wait.c**<br>
        Write a C program to demonstrate the use of fork(), exec() and wait() all in one program. 
        Use any one of the family of exec system calls such as execl() or execvp().
